# NLP LAB 1 - Naive Bayes classifier

Authors:
* Aurelien ROUXEL
* Ethan MACHAVOINE
* Jonathan POELGER

The project consists of 2 main parts:
  - Coding our own RNN
  - Using PyTorch's RNN

Our implementiations consists of two files, `01 code your own RNN.ipynb` and `02 using pyTorch RNNs.ipynb`, which are the completed previously given notebooks.
it uses the following libraries:
  - `datasets` for the dataset
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning utils
  - `pytorch` for the RNN and learning
